# Animated Rotated Text:

By using animated rotated text ideas you can create an awesome look for your headers or add a more modern look to your web design because it's simply based on fundamentals of HTML and CSS only without needing any Javascript logic.

The Idea is to contribute your text over a number of boxes (div's) which will be the same shape with little tweaks and tips.

## Note:

To make it simple I used CSS which will lead to so much repetitive code but this is only an example but you can imagine your idea and using Sass will write definitely less code.
